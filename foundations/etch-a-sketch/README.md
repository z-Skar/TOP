# Etch a Sketch

A simple Etch-a-Sketch site implemented with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This site will allow you to draw in a grid and change the proportion of it.

## Features

- Mouse over one square of the grid.
- That square will get a random color with a high transparancy.
- If the mouse goes over the same squeare, thetransparancy will decrease.
- It's possible to change the grid proportion, but this will erase your painting.

## Utility

This site was a great way to:
- Undestand about the input range and it's arguments.
- Work with some CSS atributes that helped me create the grid like the aspect-ratio and box-sizing.
- To know about document fragment and use it to eficiently manipulate the DOM, in this case only adding the squares of the grid in one operation.
- Use the getComputedStyle function to get the values of CSS atributes that are in an external CSS file.
- Understand the Event Delegation concept to avoid the creation of multiple Event Listeners.
